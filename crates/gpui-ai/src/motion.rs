//! Motion primitives shared by gpui-ai components.
//!
//! Every effect here is built on GPUI's animation system, so reduced-motion
//! mode resolves to a useful static frame automatically: one-shot reveals
//! settle at their end state and repeating effects (shimmer, breathing)
//! render at rest. Components opt in explicitly — nothing in this module
//! installs idle redraw on its own.
//!
//! # The motion policy
//!
//! No component spells out a duration. Every animated timing in the crate
//! resolves through [`MotionTokens`], one application-global policy that
//! [`crate::init`] installs with the crate's defaults and an application may
//! replace once, up front, for all components at a stroke.
//!
//! The policy speaks two vocabularies:
//!
//! - **Semantic roles**, the consumer-facing surface: [`MotionTokens::instant`],
//!   [`MotionTokens::quick`], [`MotionTokens::standard`], and
//!   [`MotionTokens::deliberate`] for durations, and the four spring roles —
//!   press, selection, disclosure, reflow — as [`SpringRole`] response/damping
//!   pairs. Components consume roles, never raw numbers.
//! - **Named effects**, the crate-internal table: each shipped repeating
//!   effect (shimmer, grid sweep, image pulse, status spinner, breathing, orb
//!   lattice) keeps its own tempo entry, because collapsing six tuned tempos
//!   into one "ambient" number would be a visual change wearing a refactor's
//!   clothes. These readers stay `pub(crate)`.
//!
//! A progress loop is bound to work that ends: the element carrying it is
//! gone once the work finishes. An ambient loop has no completion to report
//! and runs for as long as its element is on screen. The instant role is
//! zero by conviction, not omission: nothing in the crate delays or eases a
//! direct response to input.
//!
//! Reduced motion outranks the policy. Every effect here routes through
//! GPUI's animation system, whose reduced-motion contract no token value can
//! override — a policy with ten-second durations still renders still frames
//! when the platform asks for stillness.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use gpui_ai::prelude::*;
//! # use gpui::ParentElement;
//! # use gpui_component::v_flex;
//! # fn example(is_running: bool, window: &mut gpui::Window, cx: &mut gpui::App) {
//! use gpui_ai::motion::{Shimmer, reveal};
//!
//! // A "Thinking…" label with a travelling highlight while work runs.
//! Shimmer::new("thinking-label", "Thinking…").active(is_running);
//!
//! // A freshly inserted row fades and rises into place once.
//! reveal(v_flex().child("New tool call"), ("tool-call", 3_usize), window, cx);
//! # }
//! ```
